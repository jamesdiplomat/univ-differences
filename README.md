# Studying in America (UIUC) vs. in Switzerland (EPFL)

## 1. Cost
### 1.1. Tuition

There is no match. EPFL, ETHZ all charge less than $2,000 for students coming from anywhere in the world. Unless you have a full-ride scholarship, it will not get any cheaper than this. 

### 1.2. Accomodation

Again, if you are able to find student housing with FMEL when you are enrolled at EPFL, then your student housing option will be certainly superior. You will get your own room for between 500-700 CHF and you can eat 

In American universities, you are obliged to live in dorms your first year. 

## 2. Study environment

Swiss universities are efficient, and very no-nonsense. You don't have the university spending millions of dollars on football programs. Other than academics, they support some basic student services. For example, to go to the gym (shared with University of Lausanne, or UNIL), students need to pay $50 a semester to access. 

This is not to say life at EPFL will be boring. EPFL is designed very well that there are businesses and establishments all within walking distance, integrated with the campus itself. This is not something that you will just find on sprawling American university campuses. Convenience on campus is superior to American universities, although another consideration is that EPFL would be considered small by the standards of large American state university institutions with around 11,000 students. 

American universities offer vibrant student life with thousands of different opportunities easily accessible by the student's fingergtips, but they also come at a high cost. The costs required to support all of the sports teams. Only a few sports are financially solvent at most universities, such as football and basketball. At Swiss universities, there is usually a dedicated student-run organization working with the university to provide access to sports for student.
