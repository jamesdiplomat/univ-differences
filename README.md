# Studying in America (UIUC) vs. in Switzerland (EPFL)

## 1. Cost
### 1.1. Tuition

There is no match. EPFL, ETHZ all charge less than $2,000 for students coming from anywhere in the world. Unless you have a full-ride scholarship, it will not get any cheaper than this. 

### 1.2. Accomodation

Again, if you are able to find student housing with FMEL when you are enrolled at EPFL, then your student housing option will be certainly superior. You will get your own room (of at least 200 sq. ft), with your own bathroom depending on type of residence, for between 500-700 CHF and you can cook and eat your own food for around 150-200 CHF / USD a month. This contrasts sharply with American campuses, where your room itself will cost $800 **just for a double room in a 115 sq. ft space** and another $600 a month for a basic 12 meals + 15 (use it or lose it) dining dollars per week. Housing (along with meal plans) were one of the items that I was least content with especially the underpaid student-staff produced food that I wondered if they were edible. 

The difference in quality is even more pronounced when the cost of living is taken into account. Champaign is in a low cost of living area two hours south of Chicago, while Lausanne is a densely populated city in Lausanne in the very high COL Switzerland. 

In American universities, you are obliged to live in dorms your first year. At University of Illinois I had the cheapest dorm on campus, with no air conditioning, shared with a roommate. Your experience inside the dorm will vary heavily 

Rules of using the room are different. In Switzerland, all issues are reported to what would be your resident director, who will refer the matter to the governing body of residences (FMEL in this case) if needed. In United States, you would have resident advisors that would require residents to attend weekly meetings, and regularly check in with students. 

## 2. Study environment

Swiss universities are efficient, and very no-nonsense. You don't have the university spending millions of dollars on football programs. Other than academics, they support some basic student services - counselling, health center, academic support. For example, to go to the gym (shared with University of Lausanne, or UNIL), students need to pay $50 a semester to access. 

This is not to say life at EPFL will be boring. EPFL is designed very well that there are businesses and establishments all within walking distance, integrated with the campus itself. This is not something that you will just find on sprawling American university campuses. Convenience on campus is superior to American universities, although another consideration is that EPFL would be considered small by the standards of large American state university institutions with around 11,000 students. 

American universities offer vibrant student life with thousands of different opportunities easily accessible by the student's fingergtips, but they also come at a high cost. The costs required to support all of the sports teams. Only a few sports are financially solvent at most universities, such as football and basketball. At Swiss universities, there is usually a dedicated student-run organization working with the university to provide access to sports for student.

## 3. Safety

At UIUC, every few nights, there will be an Illini-Alert which documents a case of a crime, such as a student getting robbed or mugged, sometimes in the middle of the streets. At EPFL I have yet to hear about students getting into very unsafe situations at night, although sometimes residences can be difficult to get to. 

## 4. Public Transport

I would have to give UIUC some credit regarding public transportation. Their bus system is useful and will take you to places that you want to go, although I just used a bike for most of the times and walked during winters. 

However, the venerated Swiss public transportation system is very difficult to beat. Buses and trains come frequently, and are punctual enough to indicate the number of minutes left before reaching every station (i.e. 19 minutes from EPFL to Lausanne-Flon on M1 metro line). 

## 5. Social (and identity) Movements

University of Illinois certainly has many more "initiatives" that it creates and supports, such as a dedicated Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART). Some students would argue this deep involvement are a necessary component to ensure the well-being of students on campus, others question their effectiveness, especially compared to their cost, and believe it as overreaching into students' lives. Political groups such as Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) are much more visible on campus, along with religious figures and preachers (Mormon and Evangelical preachers), usually standing in symbolic spots with significant student traffic such as Main Quad at UIUC. 

On Swiss campuses such as EPFL, the initiatives are usually more "practical" than sociopolitical, such as sustainability. Diversity groups and programs such as RESPECT at EPFL still exist. These groups usually are advisors to the university administration and exist to provide personal support for diverse groups of students. Many of those programs work behind-the-scenes, and cases of discrimination are usually dealt along with other disciplinary infractions.
